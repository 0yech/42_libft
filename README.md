# Libft, my own 42 C Library

**Authorized external functions**

- ```write``` (from ```unistd.h```)
- ```malloc/free``` (from ```stdlib.h```)

Libft is designed to be updated throughout the 42 cursus, as it will serve as our main library for most projects.
42 projects are written under the [Norm V4](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/96987/en.norm.pdf)

42's Norm most notorious rules (just to name a few) implies things such as :

- No ```for``` loops.
- Max 25 lines per function.
- Max of one declaration or assignation per line.
- Precise indentation and formatting.
- No external functions or libraries.
- No Ternary operators.
- And many more.
